# ProductCatalog
This app is just for testing purposes. 
This app shows how to use two types of repositories.

This page contains two pages:
- Products: crud page
- Setup : where the use is able to choose what repository he is going to use (entityframework or memory)

Before run this test app. please run the next scripts files:

- 000001 - Initial Script.sql
- 000002 - InsertData.sql



Thing to improve:
- Add unit tests for both repositories, controlers.
- Add some validation framework like fluentvalidation.
