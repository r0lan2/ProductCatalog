# ProductCatalog
This app is just for testing purposes. this app shows how to use two types of repositories.
this page contains two pages:
- Products: crud page
- Setup : where the use is able to choose what repository he is going to use (entityframework or memory)

Before run this test app. please run the next scripts files:
000001 - Initial Script.sql
